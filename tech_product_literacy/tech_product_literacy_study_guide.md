## Core Computer Components

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)
- **Role**: The CPU is the "brain" of the computer
- **Functions**: Executes instructions, performs calculations, manages data flow
- **Key Characteristics**:
  - Measured in GHz (gigahertz) - indicates operations per second
  - Can have multiple cores (more cores = better multitasking)
  - Newer generations offer better performance and efficiency
- **What CPUs DON'T do**: They don't store data long-term, display graphics directly, or connect to networks

### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)
- **Types**:
  - **Integrated Graphics**: Built into the CPU, more economical
  - **Dedicated Graphics Card**: Separate component, more powerful
- **Use Cases**:
  - Essential for: 3D modeling, video editing, gaming, rendering
  - Less critical for: Basic tasks like word processing, email, web browsing
- **When to Upgrade**: Consider a dedicated GPU if you work with visual media, play modern games, or do professional creative work

### Motherboard
- **Function**: Main circuit board connecting all components
- **Contains**: CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots, chipset
- **Chipset Role**: Manages data flow between CPU, memory, and peripherals

## Memory & Storage

### RAM (Random Access Memory)
- **Purpose**: SHORT-TERM storage for currently running programs
- **Key Facts**:
  - Volatile memory (data disappears when power is lost)
  - Directly affects multitasking capability
  - More RAM = run more applications simultaneously
- **Common Misconception**: RAM is NOT for long-term file storage
- **Typical Capacities**: 4GB, 8GB, 16GB, 32GB+

### Storage Devices

#### Hard Disk Drive (HDD)
- Mechanical device with spinning platters
- **Advantages**: Cost-effective, high capacity
- **Disadvantages**: Slower speeds, moving parts can fail
- **Best For**: Bulk storage, archiving, secondary drives

#### Solid State Drive (SSD)
- Flash-based storage with no moving parts
- **Advantages**: Much faster than HDD, shock-resistant, quieter
- **Disadvantages**: More expensive per GB, typically smaller capacities
- **Best For**: Operating system installation, frequently accessed programs, portable devices

#### Hybrid Approach
Many systems use BOTH: SSD for OS and programs + HDD for bulk file storage

### Storage Capacity Units
Understanding the hierarchy (each is 1000x the previous):
- **Byte (B)**: Basic unit (8 bits)
- **Kilobyte (KB)**: 1,000 bytes
- **Megabyte (MB)**: 1,000 KB
- **Gigabyte (GB)**: 1,000 MB
- **Terabyte (TB)**: 1,000 GB
- **Petabyte (PB)**: 1,000 TB

**Practice comparing sizes**: Which is larger: 500 GB or 2 TB? (Answer: 2 TB = 2,000 GB)

## Power & Protection

### Power Supply Unit (PSU)
- **Primary Function**: Converts AC (alternating current) from wall outlet to DC (direct current) for components
- **Types**:
  - Internal PSU (desktop towers)
  - External power adapters (laptops, smaller devices)
- **Important**: Don't cheap out on PSUs - poor quality can damage components or cause fires

### Surge Protection
- **Surge Protector**: Protects against power spikes and surges
- **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**: Battery backup that keeps computer running during outages
- **Why It Matters**: Power surges can permanently damage expensive components

## Peripherals & Connections

### What Are Peripherals?
- **Definition**: External devices that connect to the computer
- **NOT Peripherals**: Internal components like motherboard, CPU, RAM
- **Examples of Peripherals**: Keyboard, mouse, monitor, printer, speakers, webcam, external drives

### Display Connections

#### HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)
- **Capabilities**: Transmits BOTH video AND audio
- **Common Use**: Monitors, TVs, projectors
- **Advantage**: Single cable for complete multimedia

#### DisplayPort
- **Use Cases**: Professional monitors, gaming displays, multi-monitor setups
- **Advantages**: Higher bandwidth than HDMI, locking mechanism, daisy-chaining support

#### VGA (Video Graphics Array)
- **Status**: Older analog connection
- **Identifying**: Blue connector with screws, trapezoidal shape
- **Usage**: Legacy monitors, older equipment

### USB Connections

#### USB Type-A
- **Recognition**: Rectangular, most common traditional USB
- **Usage**: Keyboards, mice, flash drives, older devices

#### USB Type-B
- **Recognition**: Square-ish connector
- **Usage**: Printers, larger peripherals

#### USB-C
- **Key Feature**: REVERSIBLE - can be inserted either way
- **Advantages**: Faster data transfer, power delivery, becoming universal standard
- **Modern Trend**: Replacing older USB types and even some charging ports

#### Other USB Types
- **USB Mini**: Older small devices
- **USB Micro**: Android phones (older models), small electronics

### Audio Connections
- **Onboard Audio**: Most computers have built-in audio processing (motherboard or GPU)
- **Dedicated Sound Cards**: Only necessary for professional audio work, studio recording
- **TRS Connectors**: "Headphone jacks" of various sizes (3.5mm most common)
- **Digital Audio**: Can also transmit via USB, HDMI, or DisplayPort

---

## Networking Concepts

### Ethernet (RJ-45)
- **Purpose**: Wired network connections
- **Advantages**: Faster and more stable than Wi-Fi
- **Usage**: Connecting computers to routers/switches, local area networks
- **Physical**: Looks similar to phone jack but larger (8 pins vs 4 pins)

### Routers
- **Primary Function**: Connects local network to the internet
- **Additional Roles**: Assigns IP addresses, manages network traffic, provides Wi-Fi
- **Not Just**: A simple pass-through device

### Mobile Hotspots
- **Devices That Can Create Hotspots**: Smartphones, dedicated hotspot devices, some tablets
- **How It Works**: Shares cellular data connection via Wi-Fi
- **Cannot Create Hotspots**: Printers, external drives, webcams (these are not network-capable in that way)

## Making Purchase Decisions

### Consider Your Use Case

#### Basic Computing (Web browsing, email, documents)
- Moderate CPU (2-4 cores)
- 8GB RAM sufficient
- SSD recommended for speed (256-512 GB)
- Integrated graphics adequate

#### Gaming
- Strong CPU (6+ cores, high clock speed)
- 16GB+ RAM
- Large SSD (500GB-1TB) for game storage
- Dedicated graphics card ESSENTIAL

#### Professional Work (Video editing, 3D rendering, audio production)
- High-end CPU (8+ cores)
- 32GB+ RAM for smooth multitasking
- Large, fast SSD + HDD for storage
- Dedicated GPU for visual work
- Consider dedicated sound card for audio professionals

### Desktop vs Laptop Trade-offs
- **Desktop Advantages**: More powerful, upgradeable, better cooling, more ports
- **Laptop Advantages**: Portable, built-in battery, integrated design
- **Port Considerations**: Check available ports BEFORE purchasing
  - Laptops often sacrifice Ethernet ports for thinner design
  - Consider which peripherals you'll need to connect

## 🔍 Common Misconceptions to Avoid

1. ❌ **"More storage = faster computer"**  
   ✅ Storage capacity doesn't affect speed; storage TYPE (SSD vs HDD) does

2. ❌ **"RAM stores my files permanently"**  
   ✅ RAM is temporary memory for running programs; storage drives hold files long-term

3. ❌ **"All USB cables are the same"**  
   ✅ Different USB types have different shapes, speeds, and capabilities

4. ❌ **"I need a sound card for audio"**  
   ✅ Most computers have perfectly good onboard audio

5. ❌ **"The CPU handles graphics"**  
   ✅ GPUs handle graphics; CPUs may have integrated graphics but that's a separate component

6. ❌ **"More GHz always means better CPU"**  
   ✅ Core count, architecture generation, and efficiency also matter significantly

## Study Tips

1. **Understand Functions**: Don't just memorize what components are called - understand what they DO
2. **Compare and Contrast**: Know the differences between similar technologies (HDD vs SSD, USB-A vs USB-C)
3. **Think Practically**: Consider real-world scenarios - what hardware would you need for different tasks?
4. **Visual Recognition**: Be able to identify connector types and components by appearance
5. **Units Matter**: Practice comparing storage/memory sizes across different units
6. **Internal vs External**: Distinguish between internal components and peripherals
