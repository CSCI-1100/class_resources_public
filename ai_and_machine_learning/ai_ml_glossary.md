# AI & Machine Learning Module - Glossary

*Quick reference guide to key terms and concepts covered in the AI & Machine Learning module.*

---

## A

**Analytic AI**
AI systems designed to identify patterns, trends, and make predictions based on existing data. Examples include recommendation systems, fraud detection, and diagnostic tools.

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)**
The simulation of human intelligence in computers, encompassing both analytic and generative capabilities.

**Audience** (CLEAR Framework)
The "A" in CLEAR - identifying your target population's characteristics, needs, existing knowledge, and expectations when prompting AI.

---

## B

**Bias in Training Data**
When machine learning models inherit and amplify biases present in their training datasets, leading to discriminatory outcomes. Analogy: "Studying from materials that only cover certain perspectives."

---

## C

**CLEAR Framework**
A structured approach for effective AI prompting consisting of:
- **C**larity: Specific, well-defined goals
- **L**ogistics: Practical details and desired output
- **E**xamples: Demonstrations of intended results
- **A**udience: Target population characteristics
- **R**efinement: Iterative improvement through feedback

**Clarity** (CLEAR Framework)
The "C" in CLEAR - ensuring prompts have specific, well-defined goals rather than vague requests.

**Committee Analogy**
A way to understand neural networks where each layer represents different levels of decision-makers (junior members, specialists, senior analysts, final decision-makers) who vote with different weights.

---

## D

**Data Collection**
The first step in the machine learning process involving gathering relevant, representative datasets with considerations for completeness, accuracy, and relevance.

---

## E

**Examples** (CLEAR Framework)
The "E" in CLEAR - providing demonstrations of intended output and specifying what you don't want in AI prompts.

---

## G

**Generative AI**
AI systems designed for creation and content generation. Examples include ChatGPT (text), DALL-E (images), and GitHub Copilot (code).

---

## H

**Hidden Layers**
Middle layers in neural networks that process information between input and output. In the committee analogy, these represent specialists and senior analysts who focus on specific aspects and broader insights.

---

## I

**Information Literacy**
The ability to critically evaluate and verify information, particularly important in the AI era due to the potential for misinformation and confident-sounding but incorrect AI responses.

**Input Layer**
The first layer of a neural network that receives initial data. In the committee analogy, these are junior members analyzing basic features like edges, corners, lines, and curves.

---

## L

**Large Language Models (LLMs)**
AI systems that generate text by predicting the most likely next words based on training data. Examples include ChatGPT and Claude.

**Logistics** (CLEAR Framework)
The "L" in CLEAR - including practical details such as input types, steps to take, and desired output format in AI prompts.

---

## M

**Machine Learning (ML)**
A subset of Analytic AI focused on pattern recognition and prediction from data, following a three-step process: data collection, training, and prediction.

---

## N

**Natural Language Interface**
The ability to communicate with AI systems using everyday language rather than specific programming code or syntax, making AI more accessible to general users.

**Neural Networks**
AI systems inspired by biological brain networks, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information through multiple layers to recognize patterns.

---

## O

**Output Layer**
The final layer of a neural network that produces the final decision or prediction. In the committee analogy, these are the decision-makers who announce the final weighted results.

**Overfitting**
When a machine learning model memorizes specific training examples instead of learning general patterns, leading to poor performance on new data. Analogy: "Memorizing specific practice problems instead of understanding concepts."

---

## P

**Pattern Recognition**
The ability of AI systems to identify regularities and trends in data, fundamental to how neural networks and machine learning systems operate.

**Prediction**
The third step in the machine learning process where trained models make predictions on new, unseen data. Analogy: "Applying what you learned to solve new problems."

**Prediction Reality**
The critical understanding that when LLMs provide information or cite sources, they are making predictions based on training data rather than accessing real-time databases.

---

## R

**RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
A technique where AI systems access and synthesize information from databases to enhance their responses, used in modern AI-enhanced search engines.

**Refinement** (CLEAR Framework)
The "R" in CLEAR - the iterative process of improving AI prompts through feedback and output specifications to optimize results.

---

## T

**Training**
The second step in the machine learning process where algorithms learn patterns from training data through iterative improvement. Analogy: "Studying for a test using practice problems."

**Three-Step ML Process**
The fundamental machine learning workflow consisting of:
1. **Data Collection** - Gathering relevant datasets
2. **Training** - Learning patterns from data
3. **Prediction** - Making predictions on new data

---

## V

**Verification Strategies**
Methods for checking AI-generated information including cross-referencing sources, checking primary sources, understanding AI limitations, and using traditional search to verify AI summaries.

---
