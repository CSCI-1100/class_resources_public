The ability to identify when information is needed and to locate, evaluate, and effectively use that information. A critical skill in navigating the modern information environment.

A process where scholarly work is evaluated by experts in the same field before publication, establishing a quality control mechanism for academic publishing.

**Predatory Journals**
Publications that charge authors fees but fail to provide expected publishing services like proper peer review, editorial oversight, or indexing, appearing legitimate while publishing low-quality research.

**Primary Source**
Original, first-hand accounts, documents, or physical objects that were created during the time under study.

**Secondary Source**
Sources that interpret, analyze, or summarize primary sources, such as textbooks or review articles.

* **Trace**: Follow information to its original source and context

**Source Evaluation**
The process of critically assessing the reliability, authority, accuracy, and purpose of information sources before using them.

A collaborative online encyclopedia that can serve as a starting point for research by providing background information and references to more authoritative sources, though it should not be the sole source for academic work.

**Wisdom of the Crowd**
The principle that collective judgment from a large group can often be more accurate than that of individuals, though this doesn't apply in cases where bias affects the entire group.
