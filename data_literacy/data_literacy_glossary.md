# Data Literacy Module - Glossary

*Quick reference guide to key terms and concepts covered in the Data Literacy module.*

---

## A

**Analyze**
The process of examining data methodically to identify patterns, relationships, and trends. A key step in transforming raw data into information.

**Archive** (Data Life Cycle)
The stage in the data life cycle where data that is no longer actively used is stored for the long term, typically for legal, historical, and recovery purposes.

---

## B

**Bar Chart**
A visualization type that uses rectangular bars to represent data values, ideal for comparing values across different categories. Best used for 5-7 categories maximum with the numerical axis starting at zero.

---

## C

**Call to Action**
An element in data storytelling that compels the audience to act on the information presented, turning insights into concrete next steps.

**Cherry-Picking**
A misleading data visualization technique where only data points that support a particular narrative are selected and presented, while contradicting data is ignored.

**Collect** (Data Life Cycle)
The initial stage in the data life cycle where data is gathered from various sources such as customer interactions, sensors, and transactions.

**Column Chart**
Similar to a bar chart but with vertical rectangles; used to compare values for different categories or to show value changes over time for a single category.

**Context**
The circumstances that form the setting for data interpretation. Essential for transforming raw data into meaningful information.

---

## D

**Data**
Raw figures, numbers, or text that serve as the starting point of analysis. The foundation of the DIKW pyramid.

**Data Life Cycle (DLC)**
The stages that data goes through from its initial creation or collection to its eventual disposal, including create/collect, store, use, share, archive, and destroy.

**Data Literacy**
The ability to read, understand, create, and communicate data. Enables informed decision-making based on data analysis.

**Data-Driven Decision Making**
The practice of using insights derived from data analysis to guide strategic choices and actions rather than relying solely on intuition or experience.

**Destroy** (Data Life Cycle)
The final stage in the data life cycle where data that is no longer needed is securely deleted or disposed of to protect sensitive information.

**DIKW Model**
A hierarchical model representing the relationships between Data, Information, Knowledge, and Wisdom, where each level builds upon the previous through increasing context and understanding.

---

## I

**Information**
Data that has been processed, organized, structured, or presented in a given context to make it useful. The second level of the DIKW pyramid.

---

## K

**Knowledge**
The synthesis of multiple sources of information over time, often manifested as frameworks and theories. The third level of the DIKW pyramid.

---

## L

**Line Chart**
A visualization type that displays information as a series of data points connected by straight line segments, ideal for showing trends over time.

---

## M

**Market Basket Analysis**
A data mining technique used to discover associations between products, showing which items are frequently purchased together. Useful for store layout optimization and targeted promotions.

**Misleading Charts**
Visualizations that distort data through techniques like omitting the baseline, manipulating the y-axis, cherry-picking data points, or using inappropriate chart types.

---

## O

**Omitting the Baseline**
A misleading data visualization technique where the y-axis doesn't start at zero, making small differences appear much more significant than they actually are.

---

## P

**Pie Chart**
A circular visualization divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportion, best used to show parts of a whole when comparing exact values is not the goal and for 5 or fewer categories.

---

## Q

**Qualitative Data**
Descriptive data that cannot be measured numerically and represents categories. Examples include opinions, observations, experiences, months, and demographic groups.

**Quantitative Data**
Numerical data that can be measured and analyzed statistically. Examples include sales figures, test scores, and experiment results.

---

## S

**Share** (Data Life Cycle)
The stage in the data life cycle where insights derived from data are distributed across an organization or with external stakeholders.

**Store** (Data Life Cycle)
The stage in the data life cycle where collected data is placed in databases, data warehouses, or cloud storage for later retrieval and use.

**Storyline**
The narrative thread that guides the audience through data in data storytelling, connecting individual data points into a coherent message.

**Structured Data**
Typically quantitative data that is highly organized in standard formats, making it easily searchable and analyzable. Examples include dates, names, addresses, and credit card numbers.

---

## U

**Unstructured Data**
Typically qualitative data that lacks a predefined format, requiring specialized tools for analysis. Examples include social media posts, text documents, and IoT sensor data.

**Use** (Data Life Cycle)
The stage in the data life cycle where stored data is processed and analyzed to extract insights, identify trends, and support decision-making.

---

## V

**Visualization**
The graphical representation of data to help identify patterns, trends, and insights that might not be apparent from raw numbers alone.

---

## W

**Wisdom**
A state of awareness and set of principles by which a person or organization acts, based on the application of knowledge. The highest level of the DIKW pyramid.

---

## Y

**Y-Axis Manipulation**
A misleading data visualization technique where the scale of the y-axis is adjusted to make trends look steeper or flatter than they actually are, depending on the desired narrative.
