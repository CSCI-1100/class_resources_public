## 1. Understanding AI Categories

### Analytic AI vs Generative AI

**Analytic AI:**
- **Purpose:** Identifies patterns, trends, and makes predictions based on existing data
- **Core Function:** Analysis, classification, prediction
- **Examples:**
  - Netflix movie recommendations
  - Fraud detection systems
  - Medical diagnostic tools
  - Traditional search engines
  - Email spam detection

**Generative AI:**
- **Purpose:** Creates new content and generates original material
- **Core Function:** Content creation and generation
- **Examples:**
  - ChatGPT (text generation)
  - DALL-E, Midjourney (image generation)
  - GitHub Copilot (code generation)

**Key Distinction:** Analytic AI analyzes and predicts, while Generative AI creates and generates.

### Applications Across Domains
- **Healthcare:** Diagnostic AI (Analytic) vs. Medical report generation (Generative)
- **Education:** Learning analytics (Analytic) vs. Personalized content creation (Generative)
- **Business:** Market analysis (Analytic) vs. Marketing copy generation (Generative)

## 2. Machine Learning Fundamentals

### The Three-Step Machine Learning Process
üìä [**Interactive Diagram: ML Three-Step Process**](https://csci-1100.github.io/class_resources_public/ai_and_machine_learning/machine_learning/ml_three_step_process.html)

**Step 1: Data Collection**
- Gathering relevant, representative datasets
- Quality considerations: completeness, accuracy, relevance

**Step 2: Training**
- **Study Analogy:** "Like studying for a test using practice problems"
- Algorithm learns patterns from training data
- Iterative improvement process

**Step 3: Prediction**
- **Study Analogy:** "Applying what you learned to solve new problems"
- Making predictions on new, unseen data
- Performance evaluation

### Machine Learning in Action
üé¨ [**Netflix Recommendation Example**](https://csci-1100.github.io/class_resources_public/ai_and_machine_learning/machine_learning/netflix_recommendation.html)

üìß [**Email Spam Detection Example**](https://csci-1100.github.io/class_resources_public/ai_and_machine_learning/machine_learning/email_spam_detection.html)

### Common Pitfalls in Machine Learning

**Overfitting:**
- **Cram Study Analogy:** "Memorizing specific practice problems instead of understanding concepts"
- Model performs well on training data but fails on new data
- **Real-world impact:** Poor generalization to novel situations

**Bias in Training Data:**
- **Biased Study Material Analogy:** "Studying from materials that only cover certain perspectives"
- Models inherit and amplify biases present in training data
- **Real-world impact:** Discriminatory outcomes in hiring, lending, criminal justice

## 3. Neural Networks

### Conceptual Understanding
üß† [**Interactive Neural Network Committee Analogy**](https://csci-1100.github.io/class_resources_public/ai_and_machine_learning/neural_networks/neural_network_committee.html)

**Committee Analogy:** Neural networks are like committees that vote, where weights determine how much each vote counts.

**Network Layers:**
- **Input Layer:** Junior members with equal votes analyzing basic features (edges, corners, lines, curves)
- **Hidden Layer 1:** Specialists focusing on specific aspects (shape, texture, size)
- **Hidden Layer 2:** Senior analysts with broader insights for complex pattern recognition
- **Output Layer:** Decision makers announcing final weighted decision (e.g., Dog 85%, Cat 12%, Bird 3%)

### From Simple to Complex
Neural networks progress from single neurons ‚Üí networks ‚Üí deep networks, enabling increasingly sophisticated pattern recognition.

## 4. Large Language Models and Generative AI

### Understanding LLMs
- **Core Reality:** LLMs make **predictions** based on training data, not real-time database access
- **Key Features:**
  - High-throughput creative capacity
  - Token-based prediction mechanisms
  - Emergent abilities from scale

### The Prediction Reality
**Critical Understanding:** When LLMs cite sources or provide information, they are making predictions based on training data, NOT accessing real-time databases.

**Implications:**
- Accuracy varies and requires verification
- Sources may be hallucinated or misattributed
- Fact-checking remains essential

### Natural Language Interface Advantage
- Communicate in natural language rather than specific code/syntax
- Democratizes access to AI capabilities
- Enables rapid prototyping and iteration

## 5. Effective AI Prompting: The CLEAR Framework

üí° [**CLEAR AI Prompting Tips**](https://csci-1100.github.io/class_resources_public/ai_and_machine_learning/clear_ai_prompting_tips.html)

### CLEAR Components:
- **C - Clarity:** Specific, well-defined goals
- **L - Logistics:** Practical details, input types, steps, desired output
- **E - Examples:** Demonstrate intended output, specify what you DON'T want
- **A - Audience:** Target population characteristics and needs
- **R - Refinement:** Iterative improvement through feedback

### Example Transformation:
**Basic Prompt:** "Tell me about Python basics"
**CLEAR-Enhanced Prompt:** "Create a comprehensive Python reference guide including fundamental data types, methods, keywords, and control structures with example usage. Format as a glossary with code snippets for each concept, designed for computer science students familiar with basic programming concepts. Output as structured markdown with clear sections and subsections."

## 6. Information Literacy in the AI Era

### How Search Has Changed with RAG
**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):** LLMs accessing and synthesizing information from databases and integrating with search engines.

### Traditional vs AI-Enhanced Search
**Traditional Search:**
- Returns list of links to relevant pages
- User evaluates and synthesizes information

**AI-Enhanced Search:**
- Provides synthesized answers from multiple sources
- AI pre-processes and summarizes information

### Critical Information Literacy Skills
**Why It Matters:** AI systems can perpetuate misinformation and present confident-sounding but incorrect information.

**Verification Strategies:**
- Cross-reference sources
- Check primary sources
- Understand AI limitations
- Question confident claims
- Use traditional search to verify AI summaries
