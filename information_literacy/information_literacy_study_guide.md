# Information Literacy Study Guide

## 1. The Modern Information Challenge

- **Information Overload**: More information is produced daily than previous generations saw in a lifetime
- **Key Challenge**: How to distinguish reliable information from misinformation in seconds or minutes rather than hours
- Traditional approaches (lengthy checklists) are too slow for modern web evaluation
- **Digital Information Environment Factors**:
  - Social media amplifies both accurate and inaccurate information
  - Anyone can publish professional-looking content
  - Emotional content spreads faster than factual content

## 2. The SIFT Method for Quick Evaluation

SIFT is a strategy used by professional fact-checkers that consists of four quick moves:

### S - STOP
- Pause and check your emotional response
- Ask yourself: "Am I reacting strongly to this information?"
- **Key Principle**: The stronger your emotional reaction, the more important it is to fact-check before sharing
- Questions to ask:
  - Do I want this information to be true or false?
  - Could my biases be influencing my reaction?
  - What is my immediate emotional response?
  - What do I already know about this topic?

### I - INVESTIGATE
- Research the source: Who created this? What's their track record and motivation?
- **Lateral Reading vs. Vertical Reading**:
  - ❌ **Vertical Reading**: Staying on the same website, trusting "About Us" pages (easily fooled)
  - ✅ **Lateral Reading**: Opening new tabs, searching for the source name, checking Wikipedia, seeing what other sources say about this source
- Quick Investigation Checklist:
  - Check if fact-checkers have evaluated the source
  - Note any conflicts of interest or bias
  - Search: [source name] + "Wikipedia" in a new tab
  - Look for the source in news articles

### F - FIND
- Look for better coverage: What do other reputable sources say about this claim?
- **Don't stop at one source!**
- Effective Search Strategies:
  - Use fact-checking sites (Snopes, FactCheck.org, PolitiFact)
  - Use Google News for recent coverage
  - Look for multiple perspectives across different types of sources
  - Find subject matter experts
- Red Flags to Watch For:
  - Only one source reporting "breaking" news
  - Reputable news sources aren't covering a major claim
  - Story contradicts established facts
  - Sources all from same political or ideological perspective

### T - TRACE
- Follow information back to its original source and context
- **What to Trace**:
  - Research studies: Find the original paper, not just press releases
  - Quotes: Verify full context, not just the excerpt
  - Statistics: Find the original data source
  - Images and videos: Use reverse image search
- Common Problems with Second-Hand Reporting:
  - Context gets lost in retellings
  - Headlines may misrepresent actual findings
  - Preliminary research gets presented as definitive
  - Correlation gets reported as causation

## 3. Finding and Evaluating Academic Sources

### Academic Database Resources
- OneSearch: Search across multiple databases simultaneously
- Subject Databases: Specialized collections for specific fields
- Research Assistance: Librarian support for complex research
- Hot Tip: Log into libraries.etsu.edu with ETSU credentials to access full-text articles and avoid paywalls

### Why Use Academic Databases Instead of Google?
- Peer-reviewed content: Experts have evaluated the research
- Credible sources: Authors identified with credentials
- Current information: Recent publications in your field
- Full-text access: Complete articles, not just abstracts

### Search Techniques
- Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT, quotes
- Advanced features: field searching, date filters, source type filters

### Evaluating Academic Sources
- Strong Sources:
  - Peer-reviewed journals
  - University press publications
  - Government research reports
  - Established research institutions
- Weaker Sources:
  - Predatory journals
  - Self-published works
  - Outdated research
  - Sources with clear conflicts of interest
  - Non-peer-reviewed preprints

## 4. Wikipedia as a Research Tool

- **Moving beyond "Wikipedia is unreliable"**
- How fact-checkers use Wikipedia:
  - Background research
  - Source mining (using Wikipedia's references)
  - Verifying credentials
  - Finding experts
- Wikipedia's Strengths:
  - Comprehensive coverage
  - Extensive citations
  - Recent updates and edit history
  - Multiple language versions
- Wikipedia's Weaknesses:
  - Open editing invites bias and vandalism
  - Anonymous authorship
  - Variable accuracy

## 5. Recognizing Misinformation Tactics

### Red Flags
- Emotional language: Excessive use of words like "shocking," "devastating"
- Lack of sources: Claims without links to original research
- Anonymous authors: No clear indication of who wrote the content
- Misleading headlines: Headlines that don't match the content
- Cherry-picked data: Selective use of statistics or quotes

### Sophisticated Misinformation Techniques
- Professional design: Websites that look like legitimate news sources
- Partial truths: Mixing accurate information with false claims
- False attribution: Fake quotes from real experts
- Manipulated images: Doctored photos or images from different contexts

## 6. Building Lasting Information Habits

### Daily Practices
- Diversify your sources: Read across the political and ideological spectrum
- Check before you share: Use SIFT on content that triggers strong emotions
- Update your understanding: Be willing to change your mind with new evidence

### Questions to Ask Regularly
- Who benefits if I believe this information?
- What might I be missing in this story?
- How does this fit with what I already know?
- What would convince me this is wrong?

### Applications of Digital Literacy
- Current Events: Use lateral reading to understand complex news stories
- Research Projects: Apply SIFT to evaluate sources for academic papers
- Cybersecurity: Identify phishing attempts and scam websites
- Personal Life: Make informed choices about health, finance, and lifestyle
