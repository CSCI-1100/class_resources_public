**HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface)**
A digital interface for transmitting both video and audio signals through a single cable. Commonly used for monitors, TVs, and projectors.

**Hotspot (Mobile)**
A feature that allows a device (typically a smartphone) to share its cellular internet connection with other devices via Wi-Fi.

---

## I

**Integrated Graphics**
Graphics processing capability built into the CPU rather than using a separate graphics card. Sufficient for basic tasks but limited for gaming or professional graphics work.

**Internal Power Supply**
A power supply unit housed within the computer case, typically found in desktop tower PCs.

---

## K

**KB (Kilobyte)**
A unit of digital storage equal to approximately 1,000 bytes (technically 1,024 bytes in binary).

---

## L

**LGA (Land Grid Array)**
A CPU socket design where contact pins are located in the motherboard socket rather than on the processor itself.

**Long-Term Storage**
Permanent data storage devices (HDDs, SSDs) that retain information even when powered off. Used for operating systems, programs, and files.

---

## M

**MB (Megabyte)**
A unit of digital storage equal to approximately 1,000 kilobytes (technically 1,024 KB in binary).

**Motherboard**
The main circuit board of a computer to which all components connect. Contains the CPU socket, RAM slots, expansion slots, and chipset.

**Multitasking**
The ability to run multiple programs or processes simultaneously. Improved by having more RAM and CPU cores.

---

## N

**Non-Volatile Memory**
Memory that retains stored data when power is removed. Storage drives (HDDs and SSDs) are non-volatile.

---

## O

**Onboard Audio**
Audio processing circuitry integrated into the motherboard or GPU, eliminating the need for a separate sound card in most cases.

---

## P

**PB (Petabyte)**
A unit of digital storage equal to approximately 1,000 terabytes.

**Peripheral Device**
An external device that connects to a computer to add functionality. Examples include keyboards, mice, monitors, printers, and external drives. Not internal components.

**PGA (Pin Grid Array)**
A CPU socket design where contact pins are located on the processor itself rather than in the motherboard socket.

**Port**
A physical connection point on a computer for attaching peripheral devices or cables. Examples include USB ports, HDMI ports, and Ethernet ports.

**Power Supply Unit (PSU)**
A component that converts AC power from a wall outlet into DC power suitable for computer components.

---

## R

**RAM (Random Access Memory)**
Volatile memory used for temporary storage of data and programs currently in use. More RAM allows better multitasking but does not provide permanent storage.

**RJ-45**
The 8-pin connector used for Ethernet networking cables. Slightly larger than telephone (RJ-11) connectors.

**Router**
A networking device that connects a local network to the internet and manages traffic between devices. Often includes Wi-Fi capability.

---

## S

**Short-Term Storage**
Temporary storage in RAM for currently running programs and active data. Contents are lost when power is removed.

**Solid State Drive (SSD)**
A storage device using flash memory with no moving parts. Much faster than HDDs, more shock-resistant, but typically more expensive per gigabyte.

**Sound Card**
A dedicated expansion card for audio processing. Only necessary for professional audio work; most users rely on onboard audio.

**Surge Protector**
A device that protects electronic equipment from voltage spikes and power surges by diverting excess electricity.

**System Unit**
The main case or enclosure housing a computer's internal components. Does not refer to the components themselves, just the housing.

---

## T

**TB (Terabyte)**
A unit of digital storage equal to approximately 1,000 gigabytes (technically 1,024 GB in binary).

**USB (Universal Serial Bus)**
A standard for connecting peripheral devices to computers, providing both data transfer and power delivery capabilities.

**USB Type-A**
The traditional rectangular USB connector, most commonly used for computers and charging adapters.

**USB Type-B**
